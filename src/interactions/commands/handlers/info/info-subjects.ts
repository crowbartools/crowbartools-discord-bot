If you're experiencing issues with the OBS integration, follow these steps to troubleshoot:  

1. **Remove the OBS WebSocket Script in Firebot, if present**  
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Scripts** > **Manage Scripts** in Firebot.  
   - Delete the \`OBS WebSockets\` script if you have it installed.  

2. **Check OBS WebSocket Server Settings**

   - Ensure the server is enabled.  
   - Verify that:  
     - You have set a password.  
     - You know the port number (default is often 4455).  

3. **Verify Firebot OBS Integration Settings**  
   - In Firebot, navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **OBS** > **Configure**
   - Ensure the following match the OBS WebSocket settings:  
     - The **password**.  
     - The **port**.  

4. **Connection Details**  
   - Are you running Firebot on the **same PC** as OBS?  
     - If yes, set the address to \`127.0.0.1\` or \`localhost\`.  
     - If no, ensure you're using the correct IP address of the PC running OBS.

If you use OneDrive to back up your documents, you can include the Firebot data folder in your OneDrive backups by creating a symbolic link. Follow these steps:  

1. Open a Command Prompt window.  
2. Paste the following command and press **Enter**:  
   \`mklink /j "%UserProfile%\\OneDrive\\FirebotData" "%appdata%\\Firebot\\v5"\`  

This command creates a symbolic link between your Firebot V5 data folder (where all your bot profiles and settings are stored) and a folder in your OneDrive. This ensures that OneDrive automatically backs up your Firebot data whenever changes are made.

If you are having issues with the automatic restore process within Firebot, you can manually restore a backup with the following steps.
## Manual Restore Steps for V5
1. Make sure you have the backup .zip file that you want to restore from handy
    - The file name will look something like \`backup_1583810006278_v5.8.0.zip\`
    - You can find backups zips from within Firebot via **Settings > Backup > Manage Backups > Open Backups Folder**
    - Or via the Run app (Win key + R) and paste in \`%appdata%\\Firebot\\v5\\backups\\\`
2. Close down Firebot
3. Open the Run app (Win key + R) and paste in \`%appdata%\\Firebot\\v5\\\`, then click OK.
4. In the file browser window that appears, DELETE the  **profiles** folder and the **global-settings** file.
5. Extract the contents of the backup zip from Step 1 into this folder to replace the just deleted **profiles** folder and **global-settings** file.
6. Start Firebot.

**What is It**
The Firebot Expert role acknowledges members of the community that have shown over time through their own initiative and merit to be insightful and helpful when it comes to user questions.

It serves to denote for other users that the individual is speaking from extensive knowledge and experience of Firebot's usage. The individual's advice/support should be weighted more heavily than that of normal users. However, this does not mean the user speaks from authority or for the Firebot dev team.


**How To Get It**
The Firebot Expert role is earned by an individual through a consistent showing of knowledge in regards to Firebot and a willingness to apply that knowledge via offering support to user questions. The individual must also have a positive impact on the community.

We do not accept applications, referrals or requests in regards to the role. Nor is there a set of criteria that must be met for the individual to receive the role. When a member of the dev team notices a user they deem fit for the role, that member will bring the user up to the other dev members and the role is given if a consensus is met.
